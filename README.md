# Library

First project of the Javascript module from the Odin Project to practice objects and constructors. 

A library page where the user can add books submitting a form with title, author, number of pages and whether it's been read or not. The book objects are stored in an array and printed out on the page. The user can also remove or mark as read/unread the books in their library.
